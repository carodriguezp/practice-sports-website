# modulo-1-evaluacion-final-crodriguez1992

## Description

This project is a responsive website layout exercise using **node y vite** and **"mobile first"**, It is built using HTML and SCSS, providing a clean and responsive design for easy customization. 

In the project we have used adalab's started Kit, which includes an HTML template engine, the SASS preprocessor and a local server and many other things. 

This Kit helps us to work more comfortably, since it automates tasks.

In the Kit there are 3 types of files and folders:

- The files that are loose in the repository root, such as vite.config.js, package.json.... They are the configuration of the project and we don't need to modify them (except this README.md, to describe your project).
- The `src/` folder: are the files of our web page, like HTML, CSS, JS...
- The `public/` folder, that has static files like images, fonts, favicon, old JavaScript libraries (jQuery, ...)
- And the `docs/` folder, which is automatically generated when we start the project. Kit reads the files inside `src/` and `public/`, processes them and generates them inside `public/` and `docs/`.
